Young tech-based businesses have a duty of validating their technology. I think one of the things to figure out early enough is if there are the right available tools for you to get  it right because the very first impressions your tech makes could make or mare it.


What i hope to get from the conference is to discuss with more industry professionals whose day to day role have a part to do with product development and mostly in how they are making their tasks easier. These days we struggle to achieve more in the shortest amount of time possible so we can always stay ahead and gain competitive advantage. Meeting some of the great players in the field can be a really enriching experience. I hope to meet more people with way more experience than me so that i would be able to boost my efficiency back home when i return. Getting to learn new techniques can improve and boost one's efficiency and induce progress in our endeavors, so i always look ahead for an opportunity to learn more.
